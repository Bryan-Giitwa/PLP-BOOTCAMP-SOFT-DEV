# Understanding variables

# In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data. For example,
# Here, number is the variable storing the value 10.
number = 10

site_name = 'power line project'
print(site_name)

# If we want to assign the same value to multiple variables at once, we can do this as:
site1 = site2 = 'power line project'
print(site1)
print(site2)
# Here, we have assigned the same string value 'Power Learn Project' to both the variables site1 and site2.

# Python is case-sensitive. So num and Num are different variables. For example,
num = 5
Num = 55

print(num)
print(Num)

# Printing Output and Collecting User Input in Python

# In Python, we can simply use the print() function to print output. For example,
print("This is plp class 2024")
